# Docker Compose with Nvidia GPU (CUDA) support on NixOS installation guide

This repository includes a step-by-step guide for running services in docker containers via docker-compose with full CUDA support. The primary target of the usage guide is for setting up deep learning projects on NixOS systems with Nvidia GPUs.

The steps are enumerated 01,02,03 so on and intended to be followed in that order. Some of the relevant files are also included (tangled from the org document) in their relevant directories.

This guide is definitely most well suited for the author's personal usage. However, contributions are most welcome.
